# Explore-Spotify

Every year, Spotify releases Spotify Wrapped. It's a combination of both one's personal streaming habits wrapped into a set of highly customized playlists, as well as playlists containing the past year's most popular hits across a variety of different genres. It's a feature completely driven by data collected by the Spotify platform – who's listening to what – and when – aggregated into a massive database of preferences used to curate the "perfect" playlist.

Thanks to GDPR and the California Consumer Privacy Act, we – as consumers – now have access to the data that Spotify collects on us. Earlier this month, I requested a copy of my data - and proceeded to run an analysis on when I listen to music, what I listen to, and how it fits in with the rest of my life.

Feel free to plug your own data in and experiment! View the writeup: https://shomil.me/explore-spotify/
